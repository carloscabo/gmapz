# GMapz v2.10

GMapz is yet another Google Maps JS library. It eases the creation of Google Maps, it's **responsive**, supports the creation of **multiple instances in the same page** (each one with its own settings), the creation of **custom styled infowindows**, and other useful helpers.
<br><br>
You can view the full documentation (WIP) and working samples at:<br>
**[http://carloscabo.github.io/gmapz](http://carloscabo.github.io/gmapz)**

# Installation

## 1a. Use as Rails gem

Simply include in your `gemfile`:
```
gem 'gmapz'
```

and run `bundle install`

Then add in your `application.js`
```
//= require gmapz
//= require gmapz.map
//= require gmapz.autocomplete
```

## 1b. Use _standalone_

If you want to add it to your project by hand, copy `src/js/gmapz/gmapz.js`, `src/js/gmapz/gmapz.map.js` and `src/js/gmapz/gmapz.autocomplete.js` (only if you need to add an autocomple input) in your project and be sure that its included in the pages **after JQuery**.

It's recommended that you give a look at: <http://carloscabo.github.io/gmapz/> for a more in deep explanation of the `pins`, and the `locations`. In this repository you have two sample files for both of them: `src/js/gmapz/gmapz.pins.js` and `src/js/gmapz/gmapz.locations.js`.

## 2. Include CSS

For the responsive features take a look to `src/css/gmapz-responsive.css` that is used in conjuction with [MQBE](https://github.com/carloscabo/MQBE).

If you want to customize the map **infobox windows** you can use `src/css/gmapz-sample-infobox.scss` as base for your own styles.
